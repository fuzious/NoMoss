  <b>Bypass MOSS technique which is used to detect code plagiarism</b>
</p>

### Link to no-moss online code editor : [NoMoss](https://no-moss.herokuapp.com/)
### What is MOSS:
Moss (Measure of Software Similarity) is an algorithm devloped by Stanford for educational purposes to code up with 
code  plagarism. This technique is being used by various competetive coding websites like CodeChef to keep a check on
plagarism.

You can see how Moss work on Stanford website - [Source](http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/publications/papers/sigmod03.pdf)

### Disadvantage of MOSS:
Although this technique is awesome but it isn't perfect. As it harms some innocent canddates while some criminals are able to escape.

### What is NoMoss?
NoMoss is a technique to bypass MOSS, which has been developed on the firm belief of

```
"No innocent should be hanged even though hundreds of criminals are to be librated."
```

### How to use:

You can use NoMoss on its online code editor - [NoMoss](https://no-moss.herokuapp.com/)

For using NoMoss on standalone systems:

1) Download JSP from [Here](https://www.java.com/en/download/win10.jsp)
2) Create a file name "input.txt" with your code inside it in the same directory as ["NoMoss.jar"](https://github.com/fuzious/NoMoss/blob/master/NoMoss.jar)
3) If your code is in JAVA or C ,add "//1" or"//2" (without quotes) respectively as the first line of your code.
4) Now run the file ["NoMoss.jar"](https://github.com/fuzious/NoMoss/blob/master/NoMoss.jar)
5) A new file "output.txt" with your code will be created.

### How it works:
It utilizes the brute-force algorithm of the technique to create a NoMoss clone of the original code.
